# Claims
**Claims** is an expense claims submission-approval system. It allows users with *Submitters* role to create claims request and view the status of the same. Submitted requests are added to a queue for users with *Approvers* role. *Approvers* can review, approve, or reject the claims. *Approvers* can also check reports of past and current claims via a reporting tool.
